Girl's Tyme failed to win, and Beyoncé later said the song they performed was not good. In 1995 Beyoncé's father resigned from his job to manage the group.

This put further strain on the family, and Beyoncé's parents separated. On October 5, 1995, Dwayne Wiggins's Grass Roots Entertainment signed the group. In 1996, the girls began recording their debut album under an agreement with Sony Music, the Knowles family reunited, and shortly after, the group got a contract with Columbia Records.\"}, {'qas': [{'question': \"Which film featured Destiny's Child's first major single?\", 'id': '56be8c8a3aeaaa14008c90a9', 'answers': [{'text': 'Men in Black', 'answer_start': 215}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': \"For which song, did Destiny's Child take home the grammy award for best R&B performance?\", 'id': '56be8c8a3aeaaa14008c90ab', 'answers': [{'text': '\"Say My Name\"', 'answer_start': 848}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': 'Who did Beyonce record with for the movie \"The Best Man?\"', 'id': '56be8c8a3aeaaa14008c90ac', 'answers': [{'text': 'Marc Nelson', 'answer_start': 1212}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': \"Beyonce's group changed their name to Destiny's Child in what year?\", 'id': '56bf7cb63aeaaa14008c9677', 'answers': [{'text': '1996', 'answer_start': 51}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': \"The name Destiny's Child was based on a quote in which book of the Bible?\", 'id': '56bf7cb63aeaaa14008c9678', 'answers': [{'text': 'Book of Isaiah', 'answer_start': 85}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': 'Debut song, \"Killing Time\" was featured on what movie\\'s sound track?', 'id': '56bf7cb63aeaaa14008c9679', 'answers': [{'text': 'Men in Black', 'answer_start': 215}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': 'What song won Best R&B Performance in the 43 Annual Grammy Awards?', 'id': '56bf7cb63aeaaa14008c967a', 'answers': [{'text': 'Say My Name', 'answer_start': 849}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': 'What singer did Beyonce record a song with for the movie, \\'\\'The Best Man\"?', 'id': '56bf7cb63aeaaa14008c967b', 'answers': [{'text': 'Marc Nelson', 'answer_start': 1212}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': \"Where did Destiny's Child get their name from?\", 'id': '56d45fcb2ccc5a1400d830f9', 'answers': [{'text': 'Book of Isaiah.', 'answer_start': 85}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': \"Destiny's Child song, Killing Time, was included in which film's soundtrack?\", 'id': '56d45fcb2ccc5a1400d830fa', 'answers': [{'text': 'Men in Black.', 'answer_start': 215}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': \"What was Destiny's Child's first major song hit?\", 'id': '56d45fcb2ccc5a1400d830fb', 'answers': [{'text': 'No, No, No', 'answer_start': 330}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': \"When did Destiny's Child release their second album?\", 'id': '56d45fcb2ccc5a1400d830fc', 'answers': [{'text': '1999', 'answer_start': 688}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': 'Who did Beyoncé sing a duet with for \"The Best Man\" film?', 'id': '56d45fcb2ccc5a1400d830fd', 'answers': [{'text': 'Marc Nelson', 'answer_start': 1212}], 'is_impossible': False}], 'context': 'The group changed their name to Destiny\\'s Child in 1996, based upon a passage in the Book of Isaiah.

Beyoncé became an ambassador for the 2012 World Humanitarian Day campaign donating her song \"I Was Here\" and its music video, shot in the UN, to the campaign. In 2013, it was announced that Beyoncé would work with Salma Hayek and Frida Giannini on a Gucci \"Chime for Change\" campaign that aims to spread female empowerment. The campaign, which aired on February 28, was set to her new music. A concert for the cause took place on June 1, 2013 in London and included other acts like Ellie Goulding, Florence and the Machine, and Rita Ora. In advance of the concert, she appeared in a campaign video released on 15 May 2013, where she, along with Cameron Diaz, John Legend and Kylie Minogue, described inspiration from their mothers, while a number of other artists celebrated personal inspiration from other women, leading to a call for submission of photos of women of viewers\\' inspiration from which a selection was shown at the concert. Beyoncé said about her mother Tina Knowles that her gift was \"finding the best qualities in every human being.\" With help of the crowdfunding platform Catapult, visitors of the concert could choose between several projects promoting education of women and girls. Beyoncé is also taking part in \"Miss a Meal\", a food-donation campaign, and supporting Goodwill charity through online charity auctions at Charitybuzz that support job creation throughout Europe and the U.S.'}]}\n","dict_keys(['title', 'paragraphs'])\n","dict_keys(['qas', 'context'])\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"An7lvGUQfrcT","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1608059717658,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":5330,"user":{"displayName":"Tong Zhao","photoUrl":"","userId":"09009965043047980599"}},"outputId":"a333d4c5-f0f1-4960-e34d-6ffcc2cac48c"},"source":["\n","from tqdm import tqdm\n","import sys\n","import spacy\n","nlp = spacy.load('en')\n","import nltk\n","nltk.download('punkt')\n","\n","def tokenizer(sequence):\n","\n","    tokens = [token.replace(\"``\", '\"').replace(\"''\", '\"').replace(\"*\",' ').replace('-', ' ').lower() for token in nltk.word_tokenize(sequence)]\n","\n","    return tokens\n","\n","def preprocess(dataset):\n","\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Reads the dataset, extracts context, question, answer, tokenizes them,\n","\n","    and calculates answer span in terms of token indices.
