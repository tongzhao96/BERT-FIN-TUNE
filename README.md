# BERT-FIN-TUNE
This is a class project done in python for question-answering tasks. Specifically, I train models on the SQuAD 2.0 dataset to predict answer span and aswerabilitoies. 

Implementing a DrQA system in Python for reading comprehension on question-answering tasks, training on the SQuAD 2.0 dataset.

Developing a similar QA system by using the BERT-base pre-trained model and the Huggingface transformers library.
